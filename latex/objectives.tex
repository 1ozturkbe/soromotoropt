\section{Objectives for first stage problem}

The goal of the first stage model is to be able to optimize for a given thrust profile.
As such, the thrust and total burn time are inputs to the model, and all of the
exterior geometry, such as the length and radius of the rocket, and the interior
geometry, such as the fuel quantities, shape parameters, and distribution, are the
outputs. We use the following objective to optimize the model

\begin{equation}
    \rm{Objective} =\prod\limits_{j=0}^{n_t-1} s^{\alpha} \times \sum\limits_{j=0}^{n_t-1} A_{\rm{fuel}}
    \times l \times r^{\beta}
\end{equation}

The constants $\alpha$ can be adjusted by the user to improve the
convergence of the model. $\beta$ helps control the aspect ratio of the
rocket if a narrower or wider ratio is desired.
