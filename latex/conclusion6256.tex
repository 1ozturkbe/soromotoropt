\section{Conclusion}

I think that shape optimization presents exciting frontiers for the use of \gls{sdp}s in engineering.
The state of the art in the engineering community in shape optimization still involves
taking an initial guess and perturbing it within an optimization loop, which is slow and
prone to getting stuck in local minima. Although I did not make a terrible amount of progress solving this
problem, it was fun to take real-world constraints
and try to formulate a tractable approximation of the second-stage \gls{srm} optimization problem
using what I have learned in 6.256.
It was a shame that I could not figure out a way to deal with the bilinearity in the
coefficients of $r(\theta)$ in the area constraint.
