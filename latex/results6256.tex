\section{Results}

For some very odd reason, even the most basic area-fitting formulation
seemed ill posed, and SeDuMi was not able to solve the \gls{sos} problems.
A sample solution is shown in Figure~\ref{fig:sampleSol}, for \gls{sos}
polynomials of order 12.

I tried a number of methods to stop a singularity from occurring at the boundary of the domain.
These included:
\begin{itemize}
    \item Changing the polynomial degrees (odd and even, since my polynomials are
    \gls{sos} only over the interval)
    \item Adding additional regularity conditions (1st and 2nd derivative) at the boundary.
    \item Adding small perturbations at the boundary through inequality constraints.
    \item Making the negative Euclidian distance of the boundary value the objective.
\end{itemize}

None of these attempts worked, although I did notice that the error of the result went down with
increasing degree, so the solver was making some sort of progress.
This is especially odd since it is possible to write constant
functions $r^2(\theta \in [-\pi, \pi])$ (circles) which satisfy the area constraints,
and yet the \gls{sos} program could not find these.

Frankly, after many hours of tinkering, I am convinced that \gls{sos} programs are not the
right method to tackle this problem. My next step would have been to take
the polynomials, determine their arc lengths, and perturb them with periodic functions (sinusoids)
of appropriate magnitude depending on the distance between the polynomials to ensure that I satisfy
my arc length and area requirements within a specified tolerance.
