\section{Geometry in polar coordinates}

Frankly, I underestimated the difficult algebra required to approximate
arc lengths and areas in polar coordinates. So I will detail it here
before I describe the constraints in my problem. Assuming that we
know the radius of our shape $r(\theta)$ for $\theta=[-\pi, pi]$,
the circumference and area of the shape is described as follows.

\begin{align}
    L & = \int\limits_{\pi}^{\pi} \sqrt{r^2 + \Big(\frac{dr}{d\theta}\Big)^2} d\theta \\
    A & = \int\limits_{\pi}^{\pi} r^2 d\theta
\end{align}

This poses some problems, since the integral of the square root of a polynomial
is not a polynomial that is amenable to \gls{sos} representation, since the
constraints need to be linear over the coefficients of the polynomial.
